# SpanishGPT
A repository of Spanish language study material to serve as training data for the computing machine in between your ears. Have a blast, mi parce! 

## Overview
This is a place to document the speeches, documentaries, and music to learn the Spanish language by country. The purpose is to document the training data I use to teach myself Spanish. I use the below media as input data then practice in the parks, streets, and buildings of Washington, DC. In DC, there are Spanish speakers from many different places, mainly El Salvador, Mexico, Venezuala, Honduras, and Guatemala. There are also folks from Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Spain, Argentina, Chile, and other Spanish speaking places. I like to take a country-level study of the language such that I have questions to ask these folks about their home countries, like dances, slang, food, history, poltics, and culture in general. Below I'll share by country some of the resources I use. The idea is that I can compile these resources here and train a model to find a similar suite of resources for language learners by country.
